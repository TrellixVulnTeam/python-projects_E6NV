# python-projects
This is a repo for all my Python projects

#### I will keep all of the projects I make in Python in this repo

##### First "project" added: Word Counter. Super simple program that counts words.

##### Second Project added: Wordsearch solver. Whilst this isn't flashy by any means, it works. The user puts in the list of words, each spaced out by one letter, and then the words they have to find, each word with a space in between. It then checks to see whether or not any of those words are in the words.txt file, which is a file of over 56,000 English words. If there are connections, it will add a line of text saying "Found the word"
